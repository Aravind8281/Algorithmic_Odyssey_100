**Greedy Algorithm Definition:**
A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, it makes the best choice at each step without considering the overall situation, aiming to reach the optimal solution through a sequence of locally optimal choices.

**Use Case:**
One common use case is the "Fractional Knapsack Problem." In this scenario, items with weights and values are given, and the goal is to maximize the total value in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. The greedy strategy involves selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio at each step.

**Advantages over Others:**
1. **Simplicity:** Greedy algorithms are often straightforward and easy to implement.
2. **Efficiency:** Greedy algorithms can have lower time complexity compared to other approaches, making them efficient for certain problem types.
3. **Approximation Algorithms:** In some cases, greedy algorithms provide approximate solutions that are close to the optimal solution, which can be sufficient for certain applications.

**Disadvantage:**
1. **Lack of Global Optimality Guarantee:** Greedy algorithms might not always lead to the globally optimal solution. Making locally optimal choices at each step doesn't guarantee the best overall solution.
2. **No Backtracking:** Once a choice is made, a greedy algorithm does not reconsider it. This lack of backtracking may lead to suboptimal solutions.
