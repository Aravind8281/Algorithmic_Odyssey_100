1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2)
   - Time Complexity (Best Case): O(n) - when the array is already sorted

2. **Selection Sort:**
   - Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2)
   - Time Complexity (Best Case): O(n^2)

3. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2)
   - Time Complexity (Best Case): O(n) - when the array is already sorted

4. **Merge Sort:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) - in all cases (worst, average, and best)

5. **Quick Sort:**
   - Time Complexity (Worst Case): O(n^2) - can be improved with optimizations
   - Time Complexity (Average Case): O(n log n)
   - Time Complexity (Best Case): O(n log n) - when the pivot is always the median

6. **Heap Sort:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) - in all cases (worst, average, and best)

7. **Counting Sort:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n + k) - where k is the range of input

8. **Radix Sort:**
   - Time Complexity: O(nk) - where k is the number of digits in the maximum number

9. **Bucket Sort:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - when elements are unevenly distributed among buckets
   - Time Complexity: O(n + k) - when elements are uniformly distributed among buckets
