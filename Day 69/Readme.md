# Knapsack Problems

1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:**
   - In this classic version, items can either be selected or rejected, and you cannot take a fraction of an item. The goal is to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.

2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem:**
   - In this variation, you are allowed to take fractions of items. Each item has a weight and a value, and the goal is to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.

3. **Multiple Knapsack Problem:**
   - In this case, there are multiple knapsacks, each with its own capacity. The goal is to distribute the items among the knapsacks to maximize the total value.

4. **Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem:**
   - In this variation, items have multiple attributes (dimensions) that need to be considered. For example, an item could have both weight and volume constraints, and the goal is to maximize the total value while staying within these multi-dimensional constraints.

5. **Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem:**
   - Here, each item can be selected multiple times, up to a certain limit. The goal is to find the combination of items that maximizes the total value without exceeding the knapsack capacity and the individual item limits.

6. **Bounded Knapsack Problem:**
   - Similar to the 0/1 knapsack problem, but with a restriction on the number of copies available for each item. Each item has a specific quantity, and the goal is to maximize the total value while respecting both weight and quantity constraints.

7. **Time-dependent Knapsack Problem:**
   - In this variant, the value and weight of items may vary over time. The goal is to determine the optimal selection of items over a specified time horizon, considering the changing characteristics of the items.

8. **Group Knapsack Problem:**
   - Items are grouped into sets, and you must select entire sets rather than individual items. Each group has its own weight and value, and the goal is to maximize the total value while staying within the weight constraint.

**Space Complexity : O(nW)**
