Linked List Implementation !!

A linked list is a dynamic data structure consisting of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node. 
It offers efficient insertions and deletions, as elements are not required to be stored in contiguous memory. 
The singly linked list traverses forward, while doubly linked lists allow bidirectional movement.It is used in scenarios with frequent data modifications, 
such as task scheduling or real-time data streaming. Linked lists are foundational in implementing data structures like stacks, queues, and symbol tables. However, 
they have higher memory overhead compared to arrays due to storing additional pointers.
